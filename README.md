# FanTheory

Out in this Digital World, where e-commerce is at a boom, all the Pop Culture Fanatics are in search for a way to match their super heroes. From Marvel to DC, from Game of Thrones to Harry Potter, all the shows/movie series produce a lot of fan merchandising products but a lack of an all-in-one store that quenches the thirst for every cult to ever exist has been missing in our digital space.

**FanTheory**, made as a part of `Web Technology Lab`, is the e-commerce solution that tries to grab this business opportunity and act as a store where fans can buy merchandise from their homes.

- Provide a one-stop platform selling merchandise from all the various pop cultures
- Making the world of superheroes accessible to their fingertips
